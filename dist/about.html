                <p>I love to have my hand in technology while aspiring to be a Full Stack Developer. I am fascinated with the

                    in general. I enjoy utilizing my skills in online business consulting and SEO marketing as well as web
                    design and other computer software engineering programs. I recently developed Event-Teller website as
                    a individual project, and the RoboRace website as a group project using React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL,
                    Postman, and Material UI.</p>
