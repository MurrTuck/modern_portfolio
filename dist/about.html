                <p>I love to have my hand in technology while aspiring to be a Full Stack Developer. I am fascinated with the
                    high pace and changing world of technology. I value my connections with clients, students and people
                    in general. I enjoy utilizing my skills in online business consulting and SEO marketing as well as web
                    design and other computer software engineering programs. I recently developed Event-Teller website as
                    a individual project, and the RoboRace website as a group project using React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL,
                    Postman, and Material UI.</p>
                <p>I am driven by my love of software evolution and passionate about technology that promotes the ever-changing
                    tech world as it advances.</p>

                <h4>Senior Sales Rep</h4>
                <p>I am a senior sales rep for Legit Local, a software program that makes it simple to obtain Google, Facebook,
                    and Yelp reviews from customers who have interacted with a business. This software is key because it
                    takes the hassle away from customers wanting to leave a review for your company on all three platforms.
                    They simply leave one positive review and it is created on all three interfaces, the ones that you choose
                    and that matter most.</p>
